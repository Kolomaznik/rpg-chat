# Rpg-chat
This is an education project for software engineering and creating a web application in word od JVM.

## Topic
The background topic of this is creating RPG-chat.
I and my friend use this to play our RPG games to improve this application by challenging real tasks.

## Structure and ideas
I create tree od git branches. 
Each branch represents one topic. 
The *main* branch is starter point with an analytic description of the whole project.

## Branches description
Branches create a same kind os tree structure. 
For better orientation, I used names like java packages.

In this section is a short definition of each branch.

### java.spring
This is the starter point for creating the application using [Java language](https://www.java.com) as the main implementation language and [Spring framework](https://spring.io) (using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)).

### java.spring.spock
Demonstrate Spock Framework for testing java code.

### java.kotlin
This is the starter point for creating the application using [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org) as the main implementation language and [Spring framework](https://spring.io) (using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)).
